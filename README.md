## üß§Image Preprocessing Steps
1. **Image Reading**:
Reads the uploaded image file and decodes it into a format that OpenCV can process. This converts the image from a file-like object to a NumPy array.

   ```python
     file_bytes = np.asarray(bytearray(uploaded_image.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
     image = cv2.imdecode(file_bytes, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
     ```

3. **Grayscale Conversion**:
Converts the color image to a grayscale image. This simplifies the image data, making it easier to process for text extraction.

   ```python
     gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
     ```

4. **Bilateral Filtering**:
An image processing technique that smooths an image while preserving edges. It averages the colors of nearby pixels, but only considers those that are similar in color, effectively reducing noise while maintaining important details.

   ```python
     filtered = cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, d=9, sigmaColor=75, sigmaSpace=75)
     ```

5. **Adaptive Thresholding**:
A method used to create a binary image based on local pixel intensity. It analyzes the neighborhood of each pixel and dynamically determines the threshold value, ensuring that text in bright areas stands out against a darker background and vice versa.

   ```python
     adaptive_thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(filtered, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
     ```

6. **Morphological Operations**:
A set of image processing techniques that manipulate the structure of an image. They involve applying techniques like dilation and erosion to enhance or suppress certain features. **Dilation** adds pixels to the boundaries of objects, while **erosion** removes pixels from the edges. These operations help in connecting gaps, smoothing irregularities, and refining the appearance of text for better extraction. 

   ```python
     kernel = np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8)
     morph = cv2.morphologyEx(adaptive_thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)
     ```
 
7. **Conversion to PIL Image**:
Converts the processed NumPy array (binary image) back into a PIL Image object. This format is often required for further processing or display in applications like Streamlit.
 
   ```python
     pil_image = Image.fromarray(morph)
     ```
 
These preprocessing steps collectively enhance the visibility of text in images while reducing noise and interference from other elements, making it easier for text extraction models to accurately read the text.
